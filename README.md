# SavePaper

"SAVE PAPER, SAVE TREES, SAVE WORLD, SAVE HUMANS"

The main intention of the project is save paper while printing bills over restaurants or many other places where we hardly care about bills and throw it in trash. 
This application helps in cost cutting for the merchants in buying papers. The bill is sent over SMS to the customer and the customer could install the mobile application to view the bill or leave the sms if he want to ignore it. 
If the customer is not interested in installing the mobile application, then he can click on the url to view the bill.
